# üö® EMAIL NOT SENT - QUICK FIX GUIDE

## Problem
Your application was submitted successfully, but the confirmation email was NOT sent:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "emailSent": false  ‚Üê ‚ùå THIS IS THE PROBLEM
}
```

---

## Root Cause
**The backend server is NOT running on your local machine.**

Your application is being saved to the production database on Render, but emails fail because:
1. Render's servers are blocked by your corporate SMTP server
2. The local backend (which can send emails) is not running

## üìß Expected Email Behavior

When working correctly:

1. **Applicant receives:**
   - Subject: "Application Received - Technical Sales Supervisor Position"
   - Contains: Application ID, confirmation, next steps
   - From: Accord Medical HR

2. **Admin receives:**
   - Subject: "New Application - Technical Sales Supervisor"
   - Contains: Applicant details, quick review link
   - To: customerservice@accordmedical.co.ke

3. **API response shows:**
   ```json
   {
       "success": true,
       "emailSent": true  ‚Üê ‚úÖ THIS SHOULD BE TRUE
   }
   ```

---

## üÜò Still Not Working?

1. **Check SMTP credentials in .env:**
   ```bash
   cat .env | grep EMAIL
   ```

2. **Test email manually:**
   ```bash
   npm run test-email
   ```

3. **Check backend is using correct port:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
   ```

4. **View detailed error logs:**
   Check the terminal where backend is running for error messages

5. **Try different email address:**
   Some email providers block automated emails

6. **Check spam folder:**
   Email might be marked as spam

## üí° For Production Deployment

To fix email on Render.com production:

**Option A:** Whitelist Render IPs in your SMTP server

**Option B:** Use cloud email service (Recommended):
- SendGrid (100 emails/day free)
- AWS SES (Very cheap, reliable)
- Mailgun (5,000 emails/month free)
- Brevo (300 emails/day free)

Update environment variables on Render dashboard with new SMTP settings.
